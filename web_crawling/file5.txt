Star Wars: The Bad Batch is an animated television series that acts as both a sequel to and a spin-off of Star Wars: The Clone Wars. It focuses on the squad known as Clone Force 99, a band of genetically enhanced clone troopers. It was announced on July 13, 2020 and premiered on Disney+ on May 4, 2021.[1] The first season has sixteen episodes,[12] and its musical score was composed by Kevin Kiner, who previously worked on Star Wars: The Clone Wars and Star Wars Rebels.[13]

The series follows the elite and experimental clones of the Bad Batch (first introduced in The Clone Wars) as they find their way in a rapidly changing galaxy in the immediate aftermath of the Clone War. Members of Bad Batch — a unique squad of clones who vary genetically from their brothers in the Clone Army — each possess a singular exceptional skill, which makes them extraordinarily effective soldiers and a formidable crew. In the post-Clone War era, they will take on daring mercenary missions as they struggle to stay afloat and find new purpose.[1]

The Bad Batch was announced on July 13, 2020, along with the producers and writers attached to the show. Dave Filoni, Athena Yvette Portillo, Brad Rau, and Jennifer Corbett were named as executive producers. Carrie Beck also served as co-executive producer and Josh Rimes as producer. Rau also served as supervising director while Corbett was named as the series' head writer.[1]

On August 5, 2021, the series was renewed for a second season.[15]

The first trailer for the first season of the Bad Batch was unveiled at a Disney investors presentation on December 10, 2020.[16] A second trailer was released on March 30, 2021.[17]
