[9]  Jon Favreau, Dave Filoni, and Kathleen Kennedy presenting a production still from Ahsoka at D23 Expo 2022 Rumors of a live-action Ahsoka Tanoâ€“led series first circulated on the internet in March of 2020,[11] just weeks after Disney CEO Bob Iger hinted at an earnings call that spinoffs of characters from The Mandalorian were in development.
[12] When Tano made her live-action debut in "Chapter 13: The Jedi" in The Mandalorian Season Two, she became a character that could be the focus of a Mandalorian spin-off,[13] and the series was officially announced by Lucasfilm Ltd. President Kathleen Kennedy on an investors day presentation on December 10, 2020.
A StarWars.com post later that day confirmed that Jon Favreau and Dave Filoni would executive produce the series, and that it would be written by Filoni and star Rosario Dawson.
[1]  On May 9, 2022, the show started production.
[14] The creator of Grand Admiral Mitth'raw'nuruodo "Thrawn," Timothy Zahn, was consulted, and will continue to be consulted with, for matters concerning the Grand Admiral's character[15] to make sure Thrawn was written just right.
