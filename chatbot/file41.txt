Star Wars: Skeleton Crew[1] is a forthcoming live-action television series to be released on Disney+ in 2023. It was announced on May 17, 2022 under the code name Grammar Rodeo and will be set after Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi. It will be created and executive produced by Jon Watts and Chris Ford. The series will center around a group of children lost in space.

Skeleton Crew tells the story of four kids who find themselves lost in in the vastness of the galaxy trying to find their way home.[6]

On May 17, 2022 Vanity Fair reported that a Star Wars series was in development for Disney+, with Spider-Man: No Way Home director Jon Watts serving as creator and executive producer. Spider-Man: Homecoming writer Chris Ford will serve as writer.[2] Later that month, during Celebration Anaheim, the name of the show and further details were revealed, including the casting of Jude Law.[7] Jon Favreau and Dave Filoni, the creators of the shows The Mandalorian and Ahsoka, which take place around the same time frame,[7] are serving as executive producers.[1] While filming Spider-Man: No Way Home, Favreau asked Watts if he was interested in directing Star Wars. Instead, Watts pitched his idea for a new series. Favreau called Filoni from Atlanta, and they joined a video call, where Watts pitched his idea.[8]

Filming wrapped up in January, 2023.[9]
