Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi is a series of six animated anthology shorts that was released on October 26, 2022. Each episode features Jedi from the era of the prequel trilogy; one half of the episodes focuses on Count Dooku, while the other focus upon Ahsoka Tano, with other Jedi featuring as supporting characters in the shorts. Created and written by Dave Filoni, the six-episode series is animated in the style of Star Wars: The Clone Wars and Star Wars: The Bad Batch.

Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi was officially announced on April 27, 2022, as part of a schedule of panels for the upcoming Star Wars Celebration Anaheim 2022 convention. A panel about Tales of the Jedi was held on May 28, the third day of the convention, hosted by Amy Ratcliffe with Dave Filoni as a special guest.[1] The existence of the series was first leaked in December 2021 through a logo included on a Lucasfilm employee Christmas gift, images of which were released on the Internet.[11] It was later hinted at by Kevin Kiner, who worked on the music for Tales of the Jedi, and described it as an upcoming animated project that they couldn't talk about.[12] The show shares its name with Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi, a comic book maxiseries in the Star Wars Legends continuity[13] published by Dark Horse Comics between the years 1993[14] and 1998.[15] A trailer was released at D23.[5]
