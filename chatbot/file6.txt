Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is an upcoming video game in the Star Wars Jedi franchise. It will be developed by Respawn Entertainment and released by Electronic Arts. It was announced on January 25, 2022, along with a strategy game and a first-person shooter.[1] The title was revealed along with early details about the game's setting in a CGI teaser trailer that premiered at Celebration Anaheim on May 27, 2022.[7] A gameplay trailer for the title was released during The Game Awards 2022 on December 8, 2022.[8]

Star Wars Jedi: Survivor picks up five years after the events of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. Cal must stay one step ahead of the Empire's constant pursuit as he continues to feel the weight of being one of the last remaining Jedi in the galaxy. Developed by the veteran team at Respawn Entertainment, Jedi: Survivor will expand upon iconic Star Wars stories, worlds, and characters, and thrilling combat first experienced in Jedi: Fallen Order. Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is being built for the current generation of gaming hardware to create a deeper and more expansive Star Wars experience for players worldwide when the game launches in 2023.[9]

Survivor adds new lightstaber stances. The balanced single-saber stance and the crowd-control-focused double-blade stance from the first game return, along with a new twin-saber stance, which is orientated around offense. Another stance exists where Cal can wield both a lightsaber and blaster.

A shortcut system features. These persist if Cal is defeated, alongside the game's meditation checkpoints.

Customization options feature for Cal (hair, facial hair, shirt, jacket, pants), alongside customization for BD-1 and Cal's lightsaber. Further customization options are unlocked through exploration.

If the player is defeated, the enemy that delivered the killing blow glows yellow after re-entering the game, and will provide rewards (including a health refill) if defeated after re-loading.[10]

Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is a sequel to Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order.[1] A novel, Jedi: Battle Scars, narrates the events between the two video games.[11]
