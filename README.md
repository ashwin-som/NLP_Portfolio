## [Overview of NLP](https://github.com/ashwin-som/NLP_Portfolio/blob/main/Overview_of_NLP.pdf)
This document provides a high level overview of NLP, it's use cases and my reason for interest in it. It also goes on to describe the three approaches to NLP ranging from the 1960s to 2010s.


## Porfolio Assignment 1
- This program takes in an input csv file of the details of people, processes the details, and re-organizes it in the form of objects to be respresented clearly. 
- To run this program, execute <code>python axs180183_portfolio1.py data/data.csv</code> in a Unix/Linux based system.
- To run this program, execute <code>py axs180183_portfolio1.py data/data.csv</code> in a Windows based system.
- Python is generally a strong choice for text processing as it has many inbuilt methods for processing. libraries such as 're' are useful as well. One downside would be that it might be a little slower than other compiled languages for runtime but this is usually overcome by maintaining good coding style.
- In this assignment, I was able to review and learn many concepts such as file IO, regex in python as well as certain inbuilt functions in python. Especially through regex, i learned some new ways of making more code more efficient for matching strings given in input to what I would require.
